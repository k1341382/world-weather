# **World Weather with tkinter GUI**

This Python application utilizes the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the [weatherapi.com](https://weatherapi.com) API to provide current weather information for any specified location.

The app consists of three main sections:

1. **Search Bar**: Allows users to search for locations worldwide using city names, country names, or postcodes.   
   - when empty, application will use current user location based on IP address.
2. **Current Weather**: Displays the weather information for the present day.
3. **3-Day Forecast**: Provides a forecast for the next three days.

## **Prerequisites**

To run this app, you need to have Python 3.x and PySimpleGUI installed. You also need to sign up for a free API key from [weatherapi.com](https://weatherapi.com/) and paste it in the **api\_key** variable in the code.

You can install the required modules via pip:

- `pip install requests`
- `pip install black`
- `pip install isort`
- `pip install pytest`
- `pip install ruff`

Alternatively run this command for automatic module installation:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## **How to Run**

To run the app, open a terminal in the folder containing the code file, and type:

`python world-weather.py`

This should open the app window.    

Enter a location manually (e.g., "London" or "BH6 5PL) and click the "Search" button (or press Enter) to update the weather information.   
NOTE: User location will be used (based on IP address) if location field left empty.

The icons in the bottom row represent the following:
   - "Feels like" temperature
   - Wind speed
   - Humidity
   - Cloud coverage
   - Pressure
